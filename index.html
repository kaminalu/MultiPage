    <h2> Hello there. </h2>
    <p>
     I believe the magic of cultural understanding has the ability to transcend differences between people and solve world problems. The propensity for creative thought to reach beyond limited personal experience in order to touch our common humanity is essential to our species' function and growth. This connection must continue to be explored. Through program and engagement coordination within an educational context, I am attempting to take advantage of modern digital tools that will help express my interest in spreading cultural connections and social awareness throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following my internship at world-leading tech startup hub, 1871, I look forward to additional opportunities to make an impact on the non-profit sector while gaining educational programming experience. As I continue to build my network and gain new insight on the tech industry, I hope to learn more about how I can grow as an individual and how I can tackle my ultimate goal: to bring culture and social awareness to those without access, and to establish community connections in an increasingly globalized world.
    </p>
