    <h2> Hello there. </h2>
    <p>
     I believe the magic of cultural understanding has the ability to transcend differences between people and solve world problems. The propensity for literature, art, philosophy, and music to reach beyond limited personal experience in order to touch our common humanity is essential to our species' function and growth. This connection must continue to be explored. By studying digital humanities, I am attempting to take advantage of modern digital tools that will help me express my interest in spreading cultural connections throughout the world. I intend to focus on establishing cultural awareness within an educational context, and am looking forward to Illinois Institute of Technology providing the skills for me to do so.
    </p>

      I just completed a summer internship at Chicago's leading tech startup hub, 1871, and look forward to additional opportunities to make an impact on the non-profit sector while gaining educational programming experience. As I continue to build my network and gain new insight on the tech industry, I hope to understand more about what it means to be a digital humanist and how I can tackle my ultimate goal: to bring culture to those without access, and to establish community connections in an increasingly globalized world.
